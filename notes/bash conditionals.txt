FILE1 -nt FILE2     FILE1 has been changed more recently than FILE2, or if FILE1 exists and FILE2 does not
FILE1 -ot FILE2     FILE1 is older than FILE2, or is FILE2 exists and FILE1 does not
FILE1 -ef FILE2     FILE1 and FILE2 refer to the same device and inode numbers

-o OPTIONNAME shell option OPTIONNAME is enabled
-z the length if STRING is zero
-n the length of STRING is non-zero


STRING1 =  STRING2      the strings are equal
STRING1 == STRING2      the strings are equal
STRING1 =~ REGEX        the string is matched by REGEX; no quotes around REGEX - use \ before space!!!
STRING1 != STRING2      the strings are not equal
STRING1 < STRING2       STRING1 sorts before STRING2
STRING1 > STRING2       STRING1 sorts after "STRING2

! EXPR          True if EXPR is false.
EXPR1 && EXPR2  True if both EXPR1 and EXPR2 are true.
EXPR1 || EXPR2  True if either EXPR1 or EXPR2 is true.
